Q4. What is the difference between ++i and i++?

Ans.
Both ++i and i++ increment the value of i by 1 but in a different way. If ++ precedes the variable, it is called pre-increment operator and it comes after a variable, it is called post-increment operator.
Increment in java is performed in two ways:
*Post-Increment (i++): we use i++ in our statement if we want to use the current value, and then we want to increment the value of i by 1.
*Pre-Increment(++i): We use ++i in our statement if we want to increment the value of i by 1 and then use it in our statement.

Example:-
int i = 1;
int a = i++; // a = 1, i = 2
int b = ++a; // b = 3, a = 3
