Q7 . Are there cases where I must use a for loop but not a while, or vice versa?

Ans.
All for loops can be written as while loops, and vice-versa. Just use whichever loop seems more appropriate to the task at hand.
So in programming, the while loop and a for loop can be used interchangeably in some cases.
In other cases, it is better to use a while loop, and then again, others, a for loop is better.
Usually we'll use the for loop when we know how many time we want to execute the loop.  (for x<=100) whereas we normally will use a while loop when the number of iterations are not known.  
(while x>0) 
Since the for loop provides incremental change of the variable, it is better to use it when "counting"
Otherwise, if we want the the condition to just be true or false example while (true) or while (false)
its better to use a while loop.
When we want the loop to break based on a condition other than the number of times it runs, we should use a while loop.
