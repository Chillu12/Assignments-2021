Q6.Can I use a double variable as a loop-control variable in a for loop?

Ans.
Yes, a double variable can be used as a loop-control variable in a for loop, especially if we want to loop through fractional 
values or increment by fractional values.
But for counting loops it is best to use an integer for the loop control variable because floating point numbers are not always exact.
The loop might not iterate through the values expected because of rounding errors. 
For example, 0.1 is always slightly wrong when represented using floating point, no matter how many bits are used.
